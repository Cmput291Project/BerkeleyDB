
Our New releaseplan is on our wikipage.


---------Out Dated-----------
--we will have two groups working simultaniously 
--the first group will work on "take a photo" and implementing the android camera 
--the second group will develop a DBAdapter, and a ListAdapter

--after the two peices of software have been developed the groups will then focus on finishing the 
other smaller parts of the project, ViewPhoto, ViewPhotos(listPhotos), ComparePhotos, and reminder.

--There will be a "surprise" after project 2 is handed in, so we will require a bit of time to 
revise our design probably until the end of this week. Then we could use a week to program and 
implement the take a photo/db and list adapters. Another week to implement the smaller features. 
This leaves us with 1 spare week to allocate into the first and second week of coding, or to be 
used for debugging the final product
