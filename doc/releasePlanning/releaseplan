Release planning Version Ver 1.0 -- March 15th, 04:00, 2012 -- Written by Stephen Romansky
--Currently we have implemented a way to store photos on the phone,
	A method to timestamp the photos, and a method to retake photos.
	
--We intend to have a method to view all the photos to monitor the change
	in the users skin over time, done by tonight. This will also be accomidated by
	a method that will let the user pick a photo from the list and display that
	photo full screen.
	
--After the above part is done we will be implementing documentation for
	all of the source files, I mean of course, we will be `verifying` that
	we have correctly documented everything.
	
--OOD should be uploaded tonight



--Future application developments, we will think about this starting on the weekend
	--I will finish up the camera, I am thinking if I have time I will code my own
		Camera picture taking activity. I will add in the tagging methods for the 
		photos, I.e. tag the photo into a Limb group, and a skin condition group.
		
	--I think tri and tanvir will work on the gui implementations more
		--this will involve the comparing photo methods
		
	--Hieu will probably be working on the user stories we developed
		--such as edit photo, delete photo, etc.
		
--That covers it for The second edition of the release plan.
	--meeting to follow.






---------Depricated plan----------
release planning v 0.0
--we will have two groups working simultaniously 
--the first group will work on "take a photo" and implementing the android camera 
--the second group will develop a DBAdapter, and a ListAdapter

--after the two peices of software have been developed the groups will then focus on finishing the 
other smaller parts of the project, ViewPhoto, ViewPhotos(listPhotos), ComparePhotos, and reminder.

--There will be a "surprise" after project 2 is handed in, so we will require a bit of time to 
revise our design probably until the end of this week. Then we could use a week to program and 
implement the take a photo/db and list adapters. Another week to implement the smaller features. 
This leaves us with 1 spare week to allocate into the first and second week of coding, or to be 
used for debugging the final product
